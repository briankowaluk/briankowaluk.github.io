    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I meet the educational requirements for this position. In 2008, I graduated with an Honors Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University in Applied Economics with a concentration in Development.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="klc">
    <div class="klc-label">Screening — Question 2</div>
    <h2>Extensive Experience Managing Staff, Leading Projects or Teams</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. In this role, I manage a team of 4 FTEs to plan and execute data-related projects and provide strategic advice that contributes to the modernization of Statistics Canada's population health statistics program. For example, I led projects to assess the feasibility and integration of digital technology, alternative data, and novel methods — including transaction data to produce population nutrition indicators, use of mobile applications and computer vision for nutrition survey collection and processing, and use of geospatial tools and alternative data to produce statistics on health care access and experience.</p>
    <p>From March 2021 to December 2021 (0.75 year), I was the Manager (EC-07) for the Public Health Intelligence and Knowledge Translation Division at the Public Health Agency of Canada. In this role, I managed a team of 4 FTEs and led strategic and horizontal projects to enable the translation of knowledge and data generated from public health surveillance programs. For example, I led a project and inter-departmental working group to develop a web-based virtual library of COVID-19 health data and evidence produced by the Government of Canada. I also led an Agency-wide project to increase departmental understanding of the key audiences of PHAC knowledge products from surveillance data by conducting user research and developing personas.</p>
    <p>From January 2018 to March 2021 (2.25 years), I was a Senior Analyst (ES-05; EC-06 equivalent) in the Data Analytics and Modelling Team at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. In this role, I led data-related projects and provided strategic advice that contributed to the implementation of the CFIA's Data Strategy, Integrated Risk Management, and Innovation priorities. I executed novel projects using data and data science approaches to support innovation in regulatory program design and delivery — including building partnerships within industry and government to solve organizational data management problems, leading industry/government emerging technology explorations (blockchain, AI), and conducting advanced data analysis to support organizational risk-based resource allocation, intelligence, and compliance and enforcement decisions.</p>

    <h2>Leading Complex Research, Analytical, or Operational Programs Linked to Data</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), as Unit Head and Acting Section Chief for the Innovation Secretariat, I led projects to assess the feasibility of using transaction data to produce population nutrition statistics. The use of transaction data to monitor nutrition and population health is not common across National Statistical Organizations — making this approach precedent-setting. Further, this approach leverages highly sensitive data holdings used in the production of the Consumer Price Index, and leveraging this data for population health carries significant risk, as it was not intended to be used for population health purposes by the data providers.</p>
    <p>From March 2021 to December 2021, as Manager at the Public Health Agency of Canada, I led a project and inter-departmental working group to develop a web-based virtual library of COVID-19 health data and evidence produced by the Government of Canada. This project was complex because it required the collaboration of many partners — Health Canada, PHAC, CIHI, CIHR, Statistics Canada — and internal service providers including web development, strategic communications, and IT.</p>
    <p>From January 2018 to March 2021, as Senior Analyst at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, I led the department's work to assess the value of blockchain technology relative to the CFIA's mandate. This involved a cutting-edge project to use blockchain technology to meet the regulatory requirements of livestock traceability with the Canadian Sheep Federation. I also led an industry-government working group to develop the Digital Food Supply Chain Use Case in the Canadian Data Governance Standardization Roadmap, and led the interdepartmental working group to develop the report "How Regulators Can Use Blockchain" published by the Blockchain Research Institute — work that was precedent-setting and multidimensional, considering emerging technology, health and economic outcomes, and regulatory compliance.</p>

    <h2>Project Management Experience</h2>
    <p>From March 2021 to December 2021, as Manager (EC-07) at the Public Health Agency of Canada, I led a project and inter-departmental working group to develop a web-based virtual library of COVID-19 health data and evidence produced by the Government of Canada. I led the team through the entire project lifecycle, from planning and execution to delivery and post-implementation review. I defined clear objectives, established a detailed project plan, and ensured the project remained on track and within budget.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, I facilitated open communication among team members, stakeholders, and clients, fostering collaboration and alignment on project goals and priorities — including weekly project status meetings with all working group members. I proactively identified and mitigated risks, resolving issues as they arose to prevent potential roadblocks. The project was successfully delivered meeting organizational expectations, resulting in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca" style="color:var(--accent);">COVID-19 health data knowledge portal on Canada.ca</a>.</p>

    <h2>Leading Complex Change or Modernization Initiatives</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021, as Unit Head and Acting Section Chief for the Innovation Secretariat, I led a project to use transaction data to produce population nutrition indicators. This project involved a comprehensive assessment of current data, methods, and approaches to the collection and production of nutrition statistics across different organizations in Canada. We identified information needs and clear options to address gaps, with roadmaps outlining objectives, timelines, resources required, and potential risks associated with each option.</p>
    <p>We engaged with key stakeholders including researchers in academia (University of Toronto), nutrition policy makers and program managers (Health Canada — Office of Nutrition Policy, Nutrition Surveillance), HSB senior management and survey program managers, and the Health Analysis Division to gain buy-in and alignment. We evaluated options based on factors such as fitness for use, scalability, necessity, and value, then used agile implementation methods and conducted a proof of concept. The use of transaction data to monitor nutrition and population health is not common across National Statistical Organizations, making this approach precedent-setting.</p>

    <h2>Data Science Experience</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021, as Unit Head and Acting Section Chief for the Innovation Secretariat, my experience encompasses various stages of the data science lifecycle — overseeing a team responsible for data acquisition, processing, analysis, modeling, and interpretation on a daily basis. My team uses data analytics cloud technology (Kubeflow, Azure) and open-source programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, as well as tools and libraries commonly used in data science. We apply data science methodologies across diverse health domains including nutrition, healthcare access, infectious disease, and oral health. Example projects include using transaction data for population nutrition indicators, using computer vision in nutrition data collection, and estimating travel costs for patients in different models of care.</p>
    <p>From January 2018 to March 2021 at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, I utilized a wide array of statistical and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, using R and SQL along with tools and libraries from dplyr, ggplot, caret, xgboost, and randomForest. Examples of projects include predicting the compliance of incoming international consignments for wood packaging regulations, and risk prediction for international e-commerce product listings relating to invasive alien species regulations.</p>

    <h2>Create Vision and Strategy</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. The mandate of this team is to drive innovation across the various activities of Statistics Canada's health statistics program. There are several ways in which I try to demonstrate this behavior on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>First, I create a vision and strategy for this team by reviewing organizational strategic documents, actively listening during meetings with senior management, and consulting with my peers in order to identify key priorities and challenges they face. For example, I have heard from senior management and colleagues that survey response rates have decreased and will not likely recover, so new sources of data will need to be identified in order to measure various population health concepts. They also indicated that collection costs for traditional data sources were increasing, highlighting the need for cost-effective alternatives.</p>
    <p>Because of this information, one of the main actions my team takes is to identify alternative sources of health data and test them for relevance to the population health program through a series of assessments. For example, a gap in nutrition data was identified, and my team identified transaction data from grocery retailers as a potential source to fill this need. My team set up a proof of concept project to analyze the transaction data to see if it could produce indicators and trends about nutrition that were relevant. Through the envisioning phase to the completion of the proof of concept, I held numerous meetings with stakeholders to communicate the objectives, potential benefits, project plan, and results. The proof of concept successfully created indicators of nutrition.</p>
    <p>My team and I have used this approach with new technologies and in several other health domains. As a result, we have gained a significant amount of knowledge of the policies, applications, and technical implementation considerations and have provided advice to the Director, Director General, and Assistant Chief Statistician on related issues, as well as provided input to various strategies like the Oral Health Statistics Program Treasury Board Submission and the Food Policy Renewal of Canada.</p>

    <h2>Mobilize People and Leadership</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. In this role there are several examples of daily activities that demonstrate my competency to mobilize people and provide leadership.</p>
    <p>For example, in order to create a sense of common purpose and direction amongst my team, I maintain an active collaborative space in MS Teams. I use MS Teams to store active documents so that they can be shared easily and worked on collaboratively. I also maintain a task board displayed to the whole team, showing when certain tasks are due, new tasks, how they fit into work priorities, and who is assigned to each task. This has the benefit of showing the team what everyone is working on, allows for linkages to be made across projects, and identifies areas to provide support while waiting on dependencies.</p>
    <p>I also maintain weekly one-on-one and team meetings to discuss projects, communicate goals and expectations, address management or administrative needs, share information, and discuss learning and performance. From time to time, I organize a "jam session" — one team member presents the status of a project or findings from analysis to the rest of the team, and in a structured way, others provide input by challenging or building on certain ideas. This allows everyone to bring their different expertise and background to each project, giving them a sense of ownership and a common vision for the outcome.</p>
    <p>These daily activities are aimed at ensuring that the team is operating with the same information and aware of the next steps for each project, so they can proactively perform tasks to meet project objectives and can switch between projects and priorities with little friction as needs arise. As a result, the team has completed and contributed to numerous projects delivering on branch, agency, and Government of Canada priorities — steadily taking on more responsibilities, building foundational assets, and building credibility with stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Collaborate with Partners and Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. In my role as Section Chief, I consistently engage in collaborative efforts with both internal teams and external stakeholders to ensure project success.</p>
    <p>One ongoing example is our current project to develop a data lake and analytics environment for oral health. Throughout the project lifecycle, I actively collaborate with our IT DAS team, internal oral health subject matter experts and survey program managers, OPMIC, DAD, and Health Canada representatives to gather requirements, define project scope, and manage expectations. Internally, I organize regular cross-functional meetings to ensure alignment among team members, gather input from various perspectives, and address any challenges. For instance, during our planning sessions, I facilitated discussions to prioritize data sources to load into the environment based on client feedback and technical feasibility.</p>
    <p>Externally, I maintain open lines of communication with Health Canada stakeholders, including management and analysts. I schedule regular check-ins, status updates, and demos to gather feedback, validate requirements, and ensure the environment is functional and on track. For example, when Health Canada was experiencing issues with the data lake's IT infrastructure, I set up a series of measures to proactively identify any infrastructure issues and established a communication protocol to ensure quick resolution.</p>
    <p>By fostering a collaborative environment both internally and externally, I leverage the collective expertise of all stakeholders to deliver high-quality solutions that meet client needs and exceed expectations. This ongoing commitment to collaboration not only strengthens client relationships but also drives innovation and continuous improvement within our organization.</p>

    <h2>Promote Innovation and Guide Change</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. In my role as Section Chief, promoting innovation and guiding change is essential to adapt to the evolving data landscape, statistical methodologies, and technological advancements.</p>
    <p>One ongoing example is an initiative to improve the collection and processing phases of a nutritional survey using AI (computer vision) technology. To promote innovation and guide this change effectively, I initiated a multi-phase approach involving collaboration with internal teams, external stakeholders, and technology partners. I conducted a comprehensive review of emerging technologies and best practices in digital data collection, identifying opportunities to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and decrease response burden.</p>
    <p>I led a cross-functional team comprising data scientists, IT specialists, and survey program managers to develop and pilot test an AI image recognition model tailored to our program's unique requirements — predicting the nutritional profile of an image of a meal. Throughout the pilot phase, I solicited feedback from end-users and stakeholders to identify usability issues, technical challenges, and areas for improvement. Based on feedback and performance metrics gathered during the pilot phase, I facilitated iterative refinements and ultimately provided a recommendation to the survey program Director on the feasibility of applying this technology to existing surveys.</p>
    <p>While our organization was not able to implement this technology as part of a national nutrition survey, by promoting innovation and guiding change the organization was able to make an informed decision based on knowledge gained from applied experimentation, gain an in-depth understanding of an emerging technology, and mitigate financial risks associated with premature implementation.</p>

    <h2>Achieve Results</h2>
    <p>Since December 2021 (2.25 years), I have been the Unit Head (EC-06) and Acting Section Chief (EC-07) for the Innovation Secretariat in the Health Statistics Branch. In my role as Section Chief, an ongoing example of this behavior is our recent effort to maximize dissemination activities for population health statistical outputs.</p>
    <p>To ensure the success of this initiative, I adopted a systematic approach focused on being evidence-driven and minimizing costs. Firstly, we conducted an assessment of our existing dissemination activities, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement. We then identified Statistics Canada web analytics data as a source and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams — including innovation and data analysts, communications staff, and survey program managers — to analyze the data and develop a targeted improvement plan. Together, we set ambitious goals to identify the factors that drive web-based engagement with population health statistical outputs.</p>
    <p>By leveraging statistical analysis techniques, we identified patterns, trends, and potential barriers. For example, we noticed that Daily articles published on Wednesdays tended to have the most engagement. We also identified March and November as the months where publishing would result in the most online engagement with statistical outputs. We shared this information with communications staff and survey program managers so that they could develop tailored communication strategies to encourage engagement.</p>
    <p>As a result of these efforts, we received positive feedback from stakeholders about the results being actionable and constructive. By consistently demonstrating the ability to achieve tangible results, I contribute to the advancement of our organization's mission and objectives in the field of health statistics.</p>
